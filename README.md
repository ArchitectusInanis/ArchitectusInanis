### Key Projects & Expertise

* **Custom Offensive Security OS:** I architect and maintain a private, custom operating system for offensive security operations. This highly optimized environment is built on Debian, integrates Kali Linux repositories, and features a custom kernel with performance patches. It also includes:
    * **AI-Driven Tooling:** Developed an autonomous AI for advanced security tasks.
    * **AI Mentorship:** Integrated an AI-powered assistant to guide and streamline complex operations.
    * **Custom Environment:** Utilizes a custom `rofi` menu for efficient toolkit navigation.
    * **Performance Enhancements:** Includes custom patches for improved user experience.

My decision to keep this project private is to protect its proprietary nature and the significant competitive advantage it provides. I can offer a private video demonstration to prospective employers.

# Omnisector

I am dedicating more time to honing my skills and as a result, I've consolidated my expertise into a single, comprehensive public project: **Omnisector**. This project serves as a definitive showcase of my capabilities, demonstrating the full breadth of my skills and reflecting my evolution as a developer since I was 17.

### A Foundation in Full-Spectrum Cybersecurity

My journey began with a fundamental curiosity about systems, leading me to a deep, five-year immersion in cybersecurity. This archived profile listed below this documents my foundational work as a **full-spectrum cybersecurity researcher and developer**. My early career was defined by a purple-shaded methodology, blending both offensive and defensive security.

**Key achievements from this period include:**

* **Pioneering AI-driven Tooling:** My work at **ShadowGuardAI** showcases my foundational skills in using AI to mass-produce defensive tools. I also developed **Event_Zero**, an experimental, AI-driven malware analysis engine that autonomously dissects malicious code to a high degree of fidelity.
* **Demonstrated Expertise:** My profile highlights top-tier performance in national competitions like the **NSA Codebreaker Challenge** (placing in the top 16% nationally as a solo competitor against multi-person university teams in 10 days of a four-month competition) and **Cyberstart America**, where I was a three-time National Cyber Scholar and consistently ranked in the top 1%.
* **Production-Grade Engineering:** Projects like **Eclipse Shield** demonstrate my ability to engineer production-grade applications with comprehensive security, addressing the full OWASP Top 10 list.
* **Valued Open-Source Contributor:** I actively contributed to the open-source community by reviving unmaintained projects and patching critical vulnerabilities in widely used tools.

This portfolio represents my evolution from a generalist developer to a specialist in advanced offensive security. The skills, drive, and achievements documented here are the bedrock of my current work, now focused on the private, specialized projects featured in this profile.

### My Journey as a Developer

This profile is a showcase of my work since age 17, representing my professional maturity and changed approach to security. I have moved from public contributions to quiet, focused development in private.

My archived profile contains projects from my earlier years and serves as a testament to my growth. The projects there, like the CI/CD automations for **ShadowGuardAI**, which used AI to mass-produce defensive tools, show my foundational skills and evolution as a security engineer.
