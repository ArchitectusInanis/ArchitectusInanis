### Key Projects & Expertise

* **Custom Offensive Security OS:** I architect and maintain a private, custom operating system for offensive security operations. This highly optimized environment is built on Debian, integrates Kali Linux repositories, and features a custom kernel with performance patches. It also includes:
    * **AI-Driven Tooling:** Developed an autonomous AI for advanced security tasks.
    * **AI Mentorship:** Integrated an AI-powered assistant to guide and streamline complex operations.
    * **Custom Environment:** Utilizes a custom `rofi` menu for efficient toolkit navigation.
    * **Performance Enhancements:** Includes custom patches for improved user experience.

My decision to keep this project private is to protect its proprietary nature and the significant competitive advantage it provides. I can offer a private video demonstration to prospective employers.

### My Journey as a Developer

This profile is a showcase of my work since age 17, representing my professional maturity and changed approach to security. I have moved from public contributions to quiet, focused development in private.

My archived profile contains projects from my earlier years and serves as a testament to my growth. The projects there, like the CI/CD automations for **ShadowGuardAI**, which used AI to mass-produce defensive tools, show my foundational skills and evolution as a security engineer.
