My primary projects on GitHub are private, serving as a dynamic portfolio of my skills I have my old CY83R-3X71NC710N profile and another highly-advanced project on this profile that demonstrates all my skills. This includes the maintenance of ShadowStrikeOS, a custom operating system designed to provide a competitive advantage in offensive security.

**ShadowStrikeOS** is not a standard hacking distribution. It's a highly optimized environment that integrates several advanced capabilities:

* AI-Driven Tooling: Features an autonomous AI, codenamed "Hyper-Lethal Vector Project," for advanced security tasks.

* AI Mentorship: Includes an AI-powered assistant, "Operator-Zero," to guide and streamline complex operations.

* Custom Security Environment: Built on the stability of Debian with Kali Linux repositories, a custom kernel, and a custom rofi menu for efficient toolkit navigation.

* Performance Enhancements: Includes custom patches for improved user experience, such as fixing VMware Fusion copy/paste on Wayland, and pre-compiled packages for speed.

Due to its proprietary nature and the significant competitive advantage it provides, this project is kept private. I am prepared to provide a video demonstration to prospective employers.

To view the GitHub profile I created when I was age 17 and under here is the archive link, my current GitHub profile is my 17+ projects so you can see how much I have grown, the GitHub profile also says everything I have done at that age. Click the GIF animation below to be directed to my old GitHub profile. I have achieved much since then.
