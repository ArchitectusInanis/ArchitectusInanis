My primary projects on GitHub are private, serving as a dynamic portfolio of my skills: I have my old CY83R-3X71NC710N profile and another highly-advanced project on this profile that demonstrates all my skills. This includes the maintenance of ShadowStrikeOS, a custom operating system designed to provide a competitive advantage in offensive security. This is the operating system that special forces hackers would use if they knew about it.

**ShadowStrikeOS** is not a standard hacking distribution. It's a highly optimized environment that integrates several advanced capabilities:

* AI-Driven Tooling: Features an autonomous AI, codenamed "Hyper-Lethal Vector Project," for advanced security tasks.

* AI Mentorship: Includes an AI-powered assistant, "Operator-Zero," to guide and streamline complex operations.

* Custom Security Environment: Built on the stability of Debian with Kali Linux repositories, a custom kernel, and a custom rofi menu for efficient toolkit navigation.

* Performance Enhancements: Includes custom patches for improved user experience, such as fixing VMware Fusion copy/paste on Wayland, and pre-compiled packages for speed.

Due to its proprietary nature and the significant competitive advantage it provides, this project is kept private. I am prepared to provide a video demonstration to prospective employers.

This archived portfolio contains my projects from when I was 17 and under. I created it to separate my earlier work from my current projects and to demonstrate my growth and changing philosophy in the art of hacking.

I used to be more active and visible on GitHub, but now I prefer to work quietly in the background.

To see the evolution of my skills and see how I've matured as a developer, you can visit my current GitHub profile, which showcases my work from age 17 and up.

I don't use this GitHub profile anymore, there are still some CI/CD automations running which is fascinating, the code most be stable enough to last years.
