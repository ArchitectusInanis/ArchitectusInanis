My GitHub profile serves as a professional portfolio, showcasing my journey from an early developer to a specialist in advanced cybersecurity. While my primary projects are private, they form a dynamic record of my skills and career growth. I can offer a private video demonstration of my proprietary work to prospective employers.

### Key Projects & Expertise

My focus is on advanced, private development that provides a significant competitive advantage. Due to its proprietary nature, I showcase the architecture and capabilities of my core projects rather than the code itself.

* **Custom Offensive Security OS:** I architect and maintain a private, custom operating system engineered for offensive security operations. Built on a hardened Debian base, this highly optimized environment integrates Kali Linux repositories and features a custom kernel with performance patches. It also includes:
    * **AI-Driven Tooling:** Developed an autonomous AI for advanced security tasks.
    * **AI Mentorship:** Integrated an AI-powered assistant to guide and streamline complex operations.
    * **Custom Environment:** Utilizes a custom `rofi` menu for efficient toolkit navigation.
    * **Performance Enhancements:** Includes custom patches for improved user experience.

### The Architect Labyrinth

I am dedicating more time to honing my skills and as a result, I've consolidated my expertise into a single, comprehensive public project: **The Architect Labyrinth**. This project serves as a definitive showcase of my capabilities, demonstrating the full breadth of my skills and reflecting my evolution as a developer since I was 17.

### A Foundation in Full-Spectrum Cybersecurity

My journey began with a fundamental curiosity about systems, leading to a deep, five-year immersion in cybersecurity. This archived profile documents my foundational work as a **full-spectrum cybersecurity researcher and developer**. My early career was defined by a purple-shaded methodology, blending both offensive and defensive security.

**Key achievements from this period include:**

* **Pioneering AI-driven Tooling:** My work at **ShadowGuardAI** showcases my foundational skills in using AI to mass-produce defensive tools. I also developed **Event_Zero**, an experimental, AI-driven malware analysis engine that autonomously dissects malicious code to a high degree of fidelity.
* **Demonstrated Expertise:** My profile highlights top-tier performance in national competitions like the **NSA Codebreaker Challenge** (placing in the top 16% nationally as a solo competitor against multi-person university teams in 10 days of a four month competition) and **Cyberstart America**, where I was a three-time National Cyber Scholar and consistently ranked in the top 1%.
* **Production-Grade Engineering:** Projects like **Eclipse Shield** demonstrate my ability to engineer production-grade applications with comprehensive security, addressing the full OWASP Top 10 list.
* **Valued Open-Source Contributor:** I actively contributed to the open-source community by reviving unmaintained projects and patching critical vulnerabilities in widely used tools.

This portfolio represents my evolution from a generalist developer to a specialist in advanced offensive security. The skills, drive, and achievements documented here are the bedrock of my current work. The archive listed below was all done at the age of 17 and below.
